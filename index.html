            <p>Here's a short bio of my background.</p>
            <p>I was born in Kansas City,Misouri. When I was nine years old, my family moved to Florida. I attended
                elementary,
                Middle School,and High School there. After graduating high school, I joined the US Army. After basic
                training,
                I was stationed at Fort Bragg,NC and was eventully sent to Germany. After my enlistment, I started
                college,
                and also joined the US Army reserve. My unit was even called up to Desert Storm/Desert Shield. I
                eventually,
                finished out my 20 year enlistment in 2000.
            </p>

            <p> I attended college at the University of North Floria, graduating in 1990. I worked for a defense
                contractor in
                Florida, before moving to Kansas to work for BNSF railway. I got married in 2005, and have worked for a
                couple
                of defense contractors as a E-Learning Developer.</p>

            <p> Most recently the City of Shawnee, Kansas as a IT Web Developer Intern. The reason I am attending this
                bootcamp
                is to become a full-stack web developer. I hope to learn alot about web development including HTML,
                CSS,
                JavaScript, among others, and now the journey begins.</p>
